Setup:
Create two Player objects with different colors (e.g., Red and Blue).

Test 1: getState():
Verify that both columns (4 and 11) are initialized to the ECstate::Available state.

Test 2: startTower():
Ensure that the startTower method works correctly by testing it for both players and verifying it returns true.

4 Available  T-G--    -----    -----    -----    -----    -----    ----- 

Test 3: move():
